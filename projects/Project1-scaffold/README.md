# Project 1 â€” Data Engineering Scaffold

This repository contains a portfolio of my data engineering projects.  
The first project is a **scaffold project** that will demonstrate:  
- Building ETL pipelines with Microsoft Fabric & PySpark  
- Data transformations with SQL & Python  
- Deploying workflows for scalable analytics  

## Next Steps
- Add sample PySpark notebooks  
- Add Fabric pipeline JSON exports
